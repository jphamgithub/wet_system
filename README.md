# üöÄ W.E.T. System: Space Toilet Water Extraction Tracker üöΩ

A simulated **space toilet monitoring system** that tracks astronaut waste extraction for water recovery.  
This project integrates multiple microservices to monitor, log, and visualize astronaut waste management.

---

## üìå Features

### üõ∞ Real-Time Monitoring (LiveTrack - ZeroMQ)
- Listens for astronaut activity events from the **Simulator**.
- Sends collected data to **WaterLog** for storage.
- Publishes real-time updates to **ViewPort** for visualization.

### üíæ Data Logging (WaterLog - SQLite & Flask)
- Stores astronaut activity (flushes, water refills, planet visits) in an SQLite database.
- Provides historical logs via a REST API for **ViewPort** and other services.
- Ensures data integrity and allows analysis of water recycling efficiency.

### üñ• Interactive GUI (ViewPort - Tkinter & Matplotlib)
- Displays **real-time astronaut activity logs** in a user-friendly interface.
- Provides **animated toilet visuals** when a flush event occurs.
- Shows **live charts** for waste volume, water levels, and astronaut usage trends.
- Fetches **motivational quotes**, **planet names**, and **station names** for immersive experience.

### üöÄ Astronaut Activity Simulator
- Generates **random astronaut events**: flushes, water refills, and planet visits.
- Uses **ZeroMQ** to publish events to **LiveTrack** for processing.
- Allows **manual event triggering** from the **ViewPort** dashboard.

## üõ† Installation

To set up and run the system, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/jphamgithub/wet_system.git
cd wet_system
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the system:

```
python3 main_program.py
```

This will launch all microservices, including:
- **WaterLog** (database & API)
- **LiveTrack** (event listener)
- **Simulator** (random astronaut activity)
- **ViewPort** (dashboard & controls)

---

## üéØ How It Works

1. The **Simulator** generates astronaut events (e.g., a flush event).
2. **LiveTrack** receives the event and logs it into **WaterLog**.
3. The **ViewPort** GUI fetches event history and updates its display.
4. Users can manually **flush** or **refill water** from **ViewPort**.
5. If water levels get low, a **planet recommendation** may be triggered.

## üîÑ Microservice Communication Flow

```
[Simulator] ---> (ZeroMQ PUB) ---> [LiveTrack] ---> (HTTP POST) ---> [WaterLog (SQLite)]
                           |
                           v
                     [ViewPort GUI]
```

- **Simulator** publishes events over **ZeroMQ**.
- **LiveTrack** listens for events and forwards them to **WaterLog**.
- **ViewPort** requests event history and updates the user interface.

## üèó Future Enhancements
- üåå **Interplanetary Water Management**: Connect with external services to monitor **off-world** water sources provided by alien microservices.

# W.E.T. System Dashboard

## Introduction
The W.E.T. System Dashboard is a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to monitor and control the Water and Environmental Technology (W.E.T.) system. It displays system status, logs astronaut waste events, and provides historical data insights. The dashboard also allows users to control the simulator, manually trigger events, and fetch random motivational quotes, planets, and stations.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change into the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd WET_System
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have Python installed, then install the required packages.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the Application**: Start the GUI application.
   ```bash
   python microservices/ViewPort/view_port.py
   ```

## Usage
### GUI Components
- **System Status**: Displays the current status of the system, including total flushes and water level.
- **Event History Table**: Shows a log of recent events with details and timestamps.
- **Chart**: Visualizes the flush-to-refill ratio over time.
- **Simulator Controls**: Buttons to start, pause, and resume the simulator.
- **Astronaut Commands**: Buttons to manually log flush and water refill events.
- **Exploration & Assistance**: Fetches motivational quotes, planets, and stations.
- **System Maintenance**: Options to refresh the dashboard and clear the database.

### Simulator Controls
- **Start/Resume Simulator**: Click to start or resume the simulator.
- **Pause Simulator**: Click to pause the simulator without freezing the GUI.

### Event Logging
- **Flush Event**: Manually log a flush event by clicking the "Remote Send Flush" button.
- **Water Refill Event**: Manually log a water refill event by clicking the "Manual Refill from Storage" button.

### Exploration & Assistance
- **Motivational Quote**: Fetch a random motivational quote.
- **Nearby Planet**: Lookup a random planet with water resources.
- **Nearby Station**: Find a station offering plumbing repairs.

### System Maintenance
- **Refresh Dashboard**: Update the display with the latest data.
- **Reset System**: Clear all stored events in the database.

## Troubleshooting
- **Error Fetching Data**: Ensure the WaterLog API is running and accessible.
- **Simulator Issues**: Check if the simulator process is running and not blocked by other applications.
